				<p>Hi! My name is Khanh Duc Tran. I'm the first generation college student in my family and currently major in Computer Science in Seattle University of Washington. My current class standing is Junior. I love coding since I was 18 years old. Beside coding, I love travelling and hanging out with friends. Until now, my most favorite project is an application about finding the shortest route path between two buildings on my UW campus.</p>
