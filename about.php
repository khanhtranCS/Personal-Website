				<p id="about">Hi! My name is Khanh Duc Tran. I'm the first generation college student in my family and currently major in Computer Science in Seattle University of Washington. My current class standing is Junior. I love coding since I was 18 years old. Beside coding, I love travelling and hanging out with friends. Until now, my most favorite project is a chrome extension that can calculate pokemon's hidden stats and locate rare/legendary pokemon in Pokemon Go.</p>
